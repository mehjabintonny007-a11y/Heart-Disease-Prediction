❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

📘 Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms.

The model analyzes various medical attributes — such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more — to determine whether a person is at risk of developing heart disease.

The goal of this project is to build an accurate, interpretable, and data-driven system that can assist doctors and health professionals in early diagnosis.
